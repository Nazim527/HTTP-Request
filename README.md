# This project contains a simple post management application using JSON-Server. Below you can find the basic steps and features of the application.
## Features
- #### When the "Create Post" button is clicked, a modal is displayed to the user containing Title and Message inputs. After filling out the inputs, a post request is sent to add a new item to the fake database.
- #### Each post card includes "Edit," "Delete," and "Like" buttons, and each works according to its own functionality.
- #### When a new post is created, the timestamp of this event is displayed on the post card.
